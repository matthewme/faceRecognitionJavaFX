# faceRecognitionJavaFX
A face recognition GUI

This program was written in eclipse with scenebuilder.

The program has a database with 72 pictures of 12 different students. When a picture of a new person is taken
the new person features will be compared to those that are in the database by getting the eigen faces. After the eigen faces are created,
the Euclidean distance is calculated and the picture closest related will be displayed.
